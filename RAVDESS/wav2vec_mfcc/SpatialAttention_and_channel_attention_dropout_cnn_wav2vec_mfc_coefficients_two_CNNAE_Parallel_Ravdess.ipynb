        "\n",
        "### Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Since our dataset is small, it is prone to overfitting - especially with highly parameterized deep neural net models\n",
        "such as the one we aim to build in this notebook. As such, we're going to want to augment our data. Generating more real samples will be immensely difficult. Instead, we can add white noise to the audio signals - not only to mask the effect of random noise present in the training set - but also **to create pseudo-new training samples and offset the impact of noise intrinsic to the dataset.**\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, the RAVDESS dataset is extremely clean - we will likely want to make predictions on noisy, real-world data - yet another reason to augment the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "We're going to use Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). It's Additive because we're adding it to the source audio signal,\n",
        "**it's Gaussian because the noise vector will be sampled from a normal distribution and have a time average of zero (zero-mean), and it's white because after a whitening transformation the noise will add power to the audio signal uniformly across the frequency distribution.**\n",
        "\n",
        "We need a good balance of noise - too little will be useless, and too much will make it too difficult for the network to learn from the training data. **Note that this is just for training - we would _not_ need to add AWGN to real-world data on which we make predictions** (although we could).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Math\n",
        "The key parameters in AWGN are the signal to noise ratio (SNR), defining the magnitude of the noise added w.r.t. the audio signal. We parameterize AWGN with the minimum and maximize SNR so we can pick a random SNR to use in augmenting each sample's waveform.\n",
        "\n",
        "We need to constrain covariance to make it true AWGN. **We make a zero-mean vector of Gaussian noises (np.random.normal) that are statistically dependent. We need to apply a [whitening transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitening_transformation)**, a linear transformation taking a vector of random normal (Gaussian) variables with a known covariance matrix and mapping it to a new vector whose covariance is the identity matrix, i.e. the vector is now perfectly uncorrelated with a diaganol covariance matrix, each point of noise having variance == stdev == 1. **The whitening transformation by definition transforms a vector into a white noise vector.**\n",
        "\n",
        "We're going to add the AWGN augmented waveforms as new samples to our dataset. **Since we generate AWGN which is random for each and every sample - random random noise - we can add multiples of our noise-augmented dataset. I'll add 2 extra identical, randomly noisy datasets with 1440 samples each to get a dataset with 1440 native + 1440x2 == 4320 noisy samples.**"
